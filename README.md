# aadc_non-worms_species
This repository contains a short script to determine if a taxon is antarctic and if it is, to know in which of those databases it is already registered : GBIF, WoRMS, RAS. It aims to generate a clear table of the taxa that need an expert validation and a push to databases of interest.
## Getting started 
If renv doesn't automatically install dependencies when you open aadc_non-worms_species.Rproj, use the following command to ensure they are installed.
```{r}
renv::restore()
```
