# aadc_non-WoRMS_species
This repository contains a script to identify Antarctic taxa and check their presence in databases like GBIF, WoRMS, and RAS. It aims to help prioritizing expert validation and database submissions for these taxa.
## Getting started 
If renv doesn't automatically install dependencies when you open AADC_non-WoRMS_species.Rproj, use the following command to ensure they are installed.
```{r}
renv::restore()
```
